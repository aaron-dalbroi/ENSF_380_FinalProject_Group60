Kinds of tasks depend of:
	1. The type of animal (e.g. feeding times)
	2. The individual animal (e.g. rebandaging an open wound)

Types of animals at EWR:
	1. Coyote
	2. Foxes
	3. Porcupines
	4. Beavers
	5. Raccons

Generic of animal taks:
-Feedings:
	- more flexibility in time range
-Cage Cleaning:
	- done once a day, when there is room in the schedule

Specific animal tasks:
-medical:
	-have to be done at the same time everyday depending on what the vet 	recommended

Animal feeding times:
*All animals must be fed in a 3 hour window*

-Cayotes: 5 min per animal, with 10 minutes of prep, crespular
-Porcupines: 5 min per animal, no prep time, crespular
-Foxes: 5 mins, 5min prep time, nocturnal
-Racoons: 5 mins, no prep, nocturnal
-Beavers: 5 mins, no prep, diurnal


Strategy to do assign tasks:
	1. Assign tasks with no flexibility
	2. Where it is more efficient to perform similar taks togethere, such 	as feeding all the cayotes at once, we will try to group these tasks.
	3. Because volunteers shifts begin and end on the hour, a task which 	spans two hours must be split into two tasks, with the associated preparation tasks being scheduled for each hour.


Things to note:
	-Usually we have one volunteer for each hour, but a backup volunteer 	can be called in if it is impossibles to fit all the tasks in otherwise
	
	-Feeding and cleaning tasks do not come from the database


QUESTIONS:
	- " If it is not possible to create a schedule, the program should report
	the problem so that Sara can contact the staff vet to request a 	change of requirements. As the staff vet
	may not be on site, Sara needs to be able to modify the start hour of 	one or more of the treatments
	based on the advice she receives. The new schedule should be created 	after the database is updated."
	
	What are some cases in which it is not possible to create the schedule?
